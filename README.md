Escc.FormControls
=================

A library for managing forms on the web using ASP.NET WebForms.

Eforms application
------------------

The `CustomControls` and `genericforms` folders are mostly code for our generic eforms system, which allows expert users to create new forms using a separate designer tool.

Form fields and validators
--------------------------

The remaining classes are designed for use on any WebForms page. In some cases they add custom functionality. In other cases they simply apply our default settings to otherwise standard ASP.NET controls.
